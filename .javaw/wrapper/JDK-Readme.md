I have to remove the JDK version from here as git has issues with large files. 
This can though be picked up from a file system or Cloud Storage(S3 in Amazon).

Note: Have to remove this instead it is now downloaded from openJdk website on each build. Not 
ideal but will work for now. And keeps the build valid.
